Christmas Toy Profit Estimator
Professor Natalino Caracol was hired by UbiquityInc, based in Rovaniemi, Lapland, to develop a program that estimates the maximum profit that can be obtained from producing and selling toys during the Christmas season.

The company produces a set of n wooden toys {x1, ..., xn}, where each toy xi has a profit li. In addition to production limits for each toy due to assembly line restrictions, the company is also limited by a total maximum number of toys that can be produced per day, due to restrictions on cutting the boreal forest. This year, UbiquityInc has decided to sell not only individual toys but also special bundles containing three distinct toys, whose profit is higher than the sum of the individual toy profits.

The objective is to determine the maximum profit that can be achieved daily by considering the production limits, individual toy sales, and special bundle sales.

Solution Approach:
The problem should be solved using Linear Programming (LP), specifically with the PuLP library in Python. PuLP provides a way to model and solve linear programming problems, optimizing for the maximum profit while respecting the constraints.

As for the project name, how about "ToyProfitMax" or "XmasToyOptimizer"? These reflect the goal of maximizing profit from toy production and sales during Christmas. Let me know if you'd like more options!
